What is Teradata ?
-----------------
History of Teradata ?
---------------------------
1.1979-Terradata was incorporated
2.1999-Largest database in the world using Teradata with 130 Terabytes.
3.2008-Teradata 13.0 released with Active Data Warehousing.
4.2012-Teardata 14.0 introduced.
5.2014-Teradata 15.0 intriduced.
6.2016-Teradata 16.0 introduced.
3.How is Teradata different from other databases?
-------------------------------------------------
* Parallelism-MIT Architecture
* Shared Nothing Architecture -Each component in TD works independently
* Linear Scalability -Teradata systems are highly scalable.They can scale up to 2018 Nodes
* Connectivity-eraddta can conncet to Channel attched system such as Mainframe or Network Attached system
* Mature Optimizer-Parallel optimizer
* SQl -ANSI
* Robust Utilities
* Automatic distributions
4.Utilities avilable in Teradta
-------------------------------------
* To import/Export data from /to Teradata system
* Fast Load
* Multi Load
* Tpump
* Fast export
* TPT(Teradata parallel Transport)
5.Important key words in TD
7.
------------------------------
MPP - Massive parallel Processing
AMP - Access Module Processor
PE - Parsing engine
SMP - Symmetric Multi Processing
BYNET - Hign speed interconnect Network
BTEQ - Basic Teradta Query
6.Teradta Architecture - Virual Processor(VPROC)
------------------------------------------------
> VPROC is the basic unit of parallelism.
> A single SMP /node is made up of multiple VPROCS.
> Each VPROC users a portion of the physical processor resources,
and space from memory pool in order to carry out the tasks.
> Each VPROC runs independently of others VPROC.
> PE(parsing Engine) and AMP (Access module procesor)are two major software components of a VPROC.
7.Teradata Archicture - parsing Engine(PE)
---------------------------------------------
* PE is a part of Vitual Processor(Vproc),
which acts as a communicator between the client system and AMP via BYNET.
* PE's tasks include:
    @ Session control(E.g.logon,authentication, and logoff).
    @ SQL parsing & error handling
    @ Generating execution plan
    @ Dispatching result set to client 
    @ Returning result set to client
* Above mentioned tasks are done in parallel for multiple clients.
8.Teradata Architecture - AMP
-------------------------------
* Amp, acronym for "Access Module Processor," is a VPROC component ,
which is userd to manage the database,handle file tasks and manipulate the disk in 
multi-tasking and parallel-processing environment.
* AMP's tasks include:
    @ Act as an interface to BYNET
    @ Database management activities:
        1.Locking
        2.Joining
        3.Sorting
        4.Aggregation
        5.Output data conversion
        6.Disk space management
        7.Journaling
* File sub-system management
9.Teradata Architecture _ PDE 
------------------------------------
* PDE, acronym for "Parllel Database Extension",is a software 
,which provides API's for various OS to interact with Teradata.
10.Teradata - Primary Index(PI)
--------------------------------------
# what is PI and it`s Significance :
  * Aprimary index (PI)is the physical mechnisam for assigning to an AMP and a location on the AMPs disks.
  * PI is also used to access rows without having to search the entire table.
  * The PI is the only way for the system determine where a row will be physical stored.
  * The columns which makes the PI for a table are specified when the table is physically created.
  * Choosing a primary index for a table is perhaps the most
    critical decision a database designer makes.Because this choice affects both data distribution and access.
  * Even if you do not define a PI in the CREATE TABLE statement .
    The TERADATA system will take the very first column to be the PI of that table.
# PI Rules
------------
  * Rule 1:One Primary index per table. 
  * Rule 2:A primary index value can be unique or non-unique.
  * Rule 3:The primary index value can be null.
  * Rule 4:The primary index of a populated table cannot be modified.
  * Rule 5:The primary index value can be modified.
  * Rule 6:A primary index has a limit of 64 Columns.
